# p5-project-downloader

An app to download a copy of all the projects from one's [p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org) (Only text based filetypes are supported). The app was inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/p5js/comments/kew2gc).

The app is currently hosted on Heroku with a free dyno which means it may be temporarily unavailable. If you can't access the app, try again in a few minutes.

### What is p5.js?

According to the [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/), it is

> a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else!

To make coding even more accessible to everyone, p5.js has a web editor which allows beginners to write code without the hassle of setting up a coding environment. Many people tend to use the web editor when they're getting started but later would like to get a local copy of their web editor projects but there hasn't been a simple way to do it. This app aims to solve this problem.
